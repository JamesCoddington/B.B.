# B.B. The Discord Moderation Bot

## What is B.B.?
B.B. is a discord moderation bot meant to crack down on toxic members in your server. When B.B. is active in your server it will automatically kick people who are using violent/harassing language. You can also check anyones aggression level to know if they are toxic or not.

## How to use
Add to a Discord server and B.B. automatically scans the discord upon every message sent. It will check each user's aggression score and kick them if they are over a specific threshold. Therefore, the bot is automatic and no controls are needed. Additionally, you can run a !check command if you want to see anyone's aggression level.
