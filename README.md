# B.B.
<br>**WHAT IS BB?**
<br>B.B. is a discord moderation bot meant to crack down on toxic members in your server. When B.B. is active in your server it will automatically kick people who are using violent/harassing language. You can also check anyones aggression level to know if they are toxic or not.
<br><br>**HOW TO USE**
<br>B.B. automatically scans the discord upon every message sent. It will check each users agression score and kick them if they are over a specific threshold. Therefore, the bot is automatic and no controls are needed. Additionally, you can run a !check command if you want to see anyone's aggression level.
<br><br>**HOW TO RUN**
<br>Before running your bot you will will have to install two things:
1. pip install vaderSentiment
2. pip install discord.py
Once these are installed you can run your bot by typing the command:
<br>**JAMES PUT THE COMMMAND HERE PLEASEEE WOOF ARUUF FRUFF FORO RUFFF PWOOROFF WOORF**

Note: Make sure you have added the bot to the server of your choice and have given it your token
